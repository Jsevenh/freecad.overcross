# Run FreeCAD with RobotCAD
In RobotCAD root directory do commands
```
cd docker
bash run.bash
```

It will build image and run FreeCAD in container then open FreeCAD window at host. Also it bind host FreeCAD mods to container.

Folder bindings (cont <-> host):

<repo>/docker/freecad/freecad_projects_save_place/ - folder for your FC projects 

<repo>/docker/freecad/freecad_appimage_dir - folder where you can place FreeCAD appImage if you want not to use default stable FreeCAD

<repo>/docker/ros2_ws/src - ROS2 workspace src inside container

<repo>/docker/ros2_ws/build_data - ROS2 workspace build folders (build, install, log, etc) inside container

~/.local/share/FreeCAD/Mod - mods of FreeCAD


# Troubleshooting

## ERROS when run FreeCAD:
"Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault."
Mean not enough rights with some folder that FreeCAD using. FreeCAD can be run with sudo or find folder (usualy ~/.local/share/FreeCAD) and "chown" it to current user
